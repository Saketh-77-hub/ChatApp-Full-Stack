# WebRTC Implementation Improvements

After restarting the frontend, the following improvements have been made to the WebRTC implementation:

## 1. Enhanced WebRTC Hook (`useWebRTC.jsx`)
- Added a reusable `createPeerConnection` function for consistent RTCPeerConnection configuration
- Improved ICE connection state handling with reconnection attempts
- Added socket reconnection handling for active calls
- Added duplicate answer handling to prevent errors
- Improved ICE candidate buffering and processing
- Added proper cleanup of media tracks when ending calls
- Added a `restartCall` function to recover from failed calls

## 2. Improved Call Modal (`CallModal.jsx`)
- Added connection status display to show users the current state of the call
- Enhanced video UI with labels for local and remote video
- Added proper audio-only call UI
- Improved ICE connection state handling with reconnection attempts

## 3. Enhanced StartCall Utility (`StartCall.js`)
- Added consistent peer connection configuration
- Added connection state validation before starting calls
- Improved error handling for failed connections
- Added call timeout handling to prevent hanging calls
- Added proper cleanup of event listeners

## 4. Socket Connection Improvements (`socket.js`)
- Added reconnection configuration with maximum attempts
- Added reconnection event handling and logging
- Added socket error handling
- Added function to ensure socket is connected before operations
- Improved socket cleanup when creating new connections

These improvements should make the WebRTC calls more reliable, especially in unstable network conditions, and provide better feedback to users about the connection status.
